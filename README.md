- "def" keyword in python
- It indeicates the start of a function, and the following intended section of code is to be stored fro later.

Python, as an Object-Oriented programming language, has these concepts: class and object.

A class is a blueprint, a model for its objects.

So again, a class it is just a model, or a way to define attributes and behavior (as we talked about in the theory section). As an example, a vehicle class has its own attributes that define what objects are vehicles. The number of wheels, type of tank, seating capacity, and maximum velocity are all attributes of a vehicle.

With this in mind, letâ€™s look at Python syntax for classes:

-init method. We call it a constructor method to create object

- For loop
  This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

- Function
  In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:
  example:
  def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")

Conditions and if statements

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
